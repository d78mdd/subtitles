2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,640
ERS-1 was the first remote sensing

3
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,360
satellite for the environment that ESA

4
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
had flown there were meteorological

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,399
satellites before but ERS-1 was the

6
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,920
pioneer

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,440
measuring all types of different

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,079
environmental information but the first

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,950
in Europe ERS-1

10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,239
[Music]

11
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,960
was the starting point for everything

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,879
that in

13
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,039
a lot of the observation capabilities

14
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,720
that we have in space now that we take

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,200
for granted after years one we had many

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,840
other missions so basically ERS-1 is

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,720
the

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,000
grandfather of all other missions

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,080
in july 1991

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,400
the European Space Agency launched a

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,640
unique earth observation satellite from

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
Europe's spaceport at Kourou

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,439
[Music]

24
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,520
and over the days after launch it's

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,040
called the launch and early operations

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
phase the satellite was stabilized the

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
instruments are switched on and then

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,119
they're checked out to see that they're

29
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,799
working correctly

30
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,640
and that's where the problem started we

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
were waiting for the first data to

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,759
arrive

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,320
and in particular the the data of the

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
radar imaging

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,280
in english Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
so we were waiting for that because that

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,399
was really the

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,720
main instrument of ERS-1 so we were

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
waiting for

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,640
you know the first image this was from

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,000
from the start this was going to be

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
exciting thing

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,479
and i think it was on uh

44
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,600
saturday

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,119
if i'm not mistaken it may have been

46
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,440
july 27th or 29th and the

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,160
data was to be received

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
there were the primary station was

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,599
Kiruna

50
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,239
and Fucino which was a secondary station

51
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,720
was was listening in

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,310
[Music]

53
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,680
a big vip event was planned down in

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,519
Fucino station for the first SAR

55
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
acquisition i think they even took the

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,319
the minister of research down there but

57
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,800
to all the italian vips

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,400
so in real time the satellite downloaded

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
the data it was recorded onto

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,480
HDDT high density digital tape

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
and the tape was played back

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
into the sar processor and

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
in those days there was a CRT

64
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,200
monitor cathode ray monitor where the

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
image as it was being processed would

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
scroll up

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,959
and what scroll up was basically

68
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,680
unrecognizable gray streaky rubbish not

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,800
a SAR image at all

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
i i always describe it as

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,640
it's like when the old tv channels used

72
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
to stop broadcasting and you get snow

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,120
nothing there so that was

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,640
uh

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,799
unexpected the

76
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,360
the image resulting in that processing

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
was very blurred blurred at the point

78
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
that my colleagues like Mark Doherty and

79
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,799
Stephen Coulson were desperate that's where

80
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,640
the panic set in i kind of think the

81
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
minister kind of said

82
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,080
we just paid

83
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
500 million euros for this

84
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,519
and

85
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,519
there was a serious concern that the

86
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,400
satellite wasn't working correctly

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
there were also a lot of

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,280
anxiety in our management

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,760
here at ESRIN at headquarters because

90
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
ERS-1 one really was the first

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
satellite and we were not completely

92
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,159
sure that the problem was in the

93
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,920
processing it could have been a problem

94
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,879
really on board with with the instrument

95
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,959
meaning that we would have failed the

96
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,400
development of that our first

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
Earth observation satellite you don't know

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,479
whether it's really a problem

99
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,639
with the satellite i don't know shaking

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,519
is it the the the SAR instrument on board

101
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,199
where there is a

102
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,160
the radar antenna partially broken or

103
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,120
not completely open

104
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,360
is it something going wrong in the

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,479
transmission of the signal

106
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,840
so there are plenty of um

107
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,479
of reasons that it does not work

108
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,919
so the tape was shipped back to ESRIN

109
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,600
and that's where

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,880
um actually Mark and Henri who were

111
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,120
leading the investigation began work to

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,280
try and find out what the problem was

113
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
i was a bit of a

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
bystander in those days but i was

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,880
obviously had some previous SAR

116
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,720
experience and was was following the

117
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
investigation we got the data from

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,720
Fucino and by the way at that time

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,280
there was no internet so someone had to

120
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,440
carry on on the card

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
the tapes it's about 100 kilometers from

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,080
here and then we we got the tape where

123
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
we had the whole data and we processed as

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,320
well and

125
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,919
did not work

126
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,720
we had a complete replica here in ESRIN

127
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
of the fast delivery processing chain

128
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,880
which is installed in all of the

129
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
receiving stations

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,759
and

131
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,320
Henri quite correctly began a very

132
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
systematic methodical

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,039
check step by step

134
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,759
of what was going on whether the data

135
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,840
was being ingested properly into the sar

136
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,680
processor whether the star processor was

137
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
configured correctly but all of this was

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
taking a lot of time and each time he

139
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,320
did a check and a run the results were

140
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,800
the same this horrible gray streaky

141
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
rubbish

142
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,720
the same thing by the way was was in

143
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,039
progress at Kiruna station

144
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
with what was called the project team so

145
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,199
these are the guys who designed and

146
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,800
built the satellite

147
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
and they were

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,720
again systematically going through so

149
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
there was a bit of a race if you want uh

150
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,360
between the project team in ESTEC

151
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
and the um

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
shall we say the amateurs down in ESRIN

153
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
the guys who who haven't built a

154
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,440
satellite but were going to process the

155
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,039
data and work on the applications

156
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
they were at a disadvantage because they

157
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,080
didn't have a system that was really set

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,160
up to let them easily

159
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,479
understand what was going wrong we had a

160
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
thing called the verification mode SAR

161
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,240
processor here in ESRIN which was fully

162
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,080
configurable you could change all the

163
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,639
processing parameters it had bells and

164
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,880
whistles you could do all sorts of

165
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
things with it and they didn't have that

166
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
at Kiruna they had a machine there the

167
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
FDPC the fast delivery processing chain

168
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
built for speed

169
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,560
uh hardwired and less configurable we

170
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
ran it through the processor and

171
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,599
actually updated common image but it it

172
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,880
was a mess

173
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,240
and uh

174
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
but what i really visibly recall from

175
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,960
that one of my our colleagues Henri Laur

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,319
who was

177
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,479
the

178
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,039
he was specialized in SAR processing

179
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
and applications i remember vividly

180
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,520
seeing Henri standing in front of this

181
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,720
awfully

182
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,800
awful image and pointing out it's

183
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,039
Flevoland there's the transponders i

184
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,080
could see these things and we were

185
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,720
awesome the guys

186
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,440
and i remember i was looking at that

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
image and i knew where it was actually

188
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,599
that image was acquired

189
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
over the Netherlands the center of the

190
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
research the the polder called Flevoland

191
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,879
and i remember i was saying to to to

192
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,520
Mark look i can recognize it's very

193
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,479
blurred

194
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
but uh here we can see Amsterdam you see

195
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,639
Utrecht? and we see Flevoland

196
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,919
and mark

197
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,479
but that's not really and he was

198
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,800
absolutely right he could recognize it

199
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,120
so we were

200
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,199
Henri was was changing the parameters

201
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,800
and he was doing this

202
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,360
with the real genius of the story who

203
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
was Paul Lim

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,919
who was the engineer in Vancouver who

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,560
had designed and built the VMP which was

206
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,319
sitting here in ESRIN

207
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,639
so we were on the phone to Vancouver

208
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,360
it was quite late in the evening here

209
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
early in the morning in Vancouver and we

210
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,399
were telling Paul what the results were

211
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,919
of the changes that he'd made to the

212
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,760
processing with Paul

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
he was actually rebuilding the software

214
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,680
in Canada

215
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,519
recompiling it so that we could run it

216
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,399
in ESRIN and we were processing the data

217
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,800
and doing the analysis and what actually

218
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,839
happened

219
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,800
was

220
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,680
we did that first processing and then we

221
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
said let's change some of the processing

222
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,920
parameters precisely what they couldn't

223
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
easily do in Kiruna we just changed the

224
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
number and re-ran the processing

225
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,880
and you know what it happened

226
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,560
it made it worse

227
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,519
we up scrolled the image it wasn't the

228
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,080
image it was the blobs and they got

229
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
further apart

230
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,600
but that was wonderful because we could

231
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
go and and

232
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
with a ruler literally on the image

233
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
measure what should have been a point

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,040
and instead was a blur and say well it's

235
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
twice as blurred as it was before then

236
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,279
we talked to Paul

237
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,600
and he said well if that's made it worse

238
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,360
maybe this could be the source of the

239
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
problem

240
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,519
and

241
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,440
what he did was

242
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,360
based on those very rough estimates uh

243
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,839
figured out that if we

244
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
flipped

245
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
a plus to a minus basically in the

246
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,320
processing maybe it would make it

247
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,200
uh better suddenly at the idea but maybe

248
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,160
we should try that which is to invert

249
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,680
what we said the

250
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,440
I/Q channel of the signal

251
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
okay let's stop

252
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
with um the systematic stuff i've got a

253
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,000
wild idea i'm going to change something

254
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,399
and let's see what happens

255
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,680
so i did that

256
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
we reconfigured the code we re ran you

257
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,079
know at that time the image did not

258
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,399
appear immediately it was ...

259
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,040
and then we saw the image as it was

260
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
being processed coming scrolling up and

261
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,839
we were just it was a perfectly

262
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,320
beautiful focused SAR image and

263
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,880
suddenly the image was perfect you know

264
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,730
like a revelation

265
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,590
[Music]

266
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,880
so that was quite a moment and when that

267
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,920
happened

268
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,279
uh mark went into orbit um there was a

269
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,680
whole stream of uh

270
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,079
shall we say colourful language it was

271
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,360
joy and jubilation i i mean i

272
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,279
i don't think you remember

273
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,959
the moments of

274
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,000
what you

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
said or what you did i think we were

276
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,120
um

277
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,519
i mean we we felt it was

278
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,480
a sort of history being made Mark

279
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,800
started to jump everywhere the handset

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,920
and the telephone fell off the desk

281
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,519
there was a little voice coming out of

282
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,760
the handset saying why i can't hear you

283
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
anymore what's happening there what's

284
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
going on

285
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,480
so we we told Paul the good news

286
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
there was an operator with us you know

287
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
it was one of the computer rooms in at ESRIN

288
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
and

289
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,079
he was from Nepal so was viewing at that

290
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,959
time

291
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,200
and Mark was really happy Mark was

292
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
jumping everywhere we are making history

293
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
we are making history we are making

294
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,920
history and that operator

295
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,959
roberto lapis

296
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,639
i'm going to call my mother and help us

297
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
to tell her any kodi was like one in the

298
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,920
night i'm making history that was really

299
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
really funny

300
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
and we

301
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,200
actually then phoned the head of the

302
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,360
department olivia morelli i think it was

303
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
about midnight

304
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,720
we also phoned the head of the

305
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
establishment francis roshan

306
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
and they both came in

307
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
uh i don't know how many heads of

308
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,959
institutes would do this today but they

309
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,480
both came in

310
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,839
and we had a glass of prosecco each and

311
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,839
saw the fantastic results

312
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,320
they were all waiting with baited breath

313
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,079
you know wondering um you know this

314
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
what's the issue are we going to solve

315
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,839
this so just being able to pass the

316
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,600
message on that the satellite worked

317
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,360
the instrument was working

318
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
perfectly

319
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,240
was you know being the bearer of of good

320
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
news and i still remember saying

321
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,720
olivia we better phone the project guys

322
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,560
in Kiruna and tell them you know we know

323
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
what it is and he said no

324
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
wait

325
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,959
until the morning i'll phone my director

326
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
tell him that we sold the problem then

327
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,590
we'll phone the project

328
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:19,649
[Music]

329
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
the first image was Flevoland and

330
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,440
actually the problem that Paul had the

331
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
genius to understand was there was a

332
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
simple

333
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,920
and stupid

334
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,519
misdefinition

335
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,760
of the signal components they're called

336
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,279
i and q

337
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,399
and the telemetry definition was the

338
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,079
inverse of the definition in the

339
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,800
processor so switching that everything

340
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
worked perfectly that was a trick it was

341
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,639
something really

342
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,199
very basic but no one were

343
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,199
confronted to that problem of the inq

344
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,519
inversion and by the way with

345
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,199
follow-on satellite we had problems like

346
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,880
that even with Envisat but we knew the

347
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
trick so immediately we do that and then

348
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,920
it worked but at that time we had no

349
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
clue

350
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
satellite was functioning perfectly the

351
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,639
SAR was functioning perfectly and i can

352
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,000
tell you

353
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,760
there were a lot of reliefed people

354
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,639
because

355
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,320
i don't think this was the first

356
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,199
satellite 500 million euros

357
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,040
and if it really was

358
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
uh kapot i don't think we would have had

359
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
ERS-2 or Envisat all the Sentinels flying

360
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,680
today

361
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,519
and you know looking back now

362
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,880
that moment was the start

363
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,680
of all of these you know amazing use and

364
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,480
application of of SAR not just with the

365
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,680
ERS-1 ERS-2 Envisat Sentinel but also

366
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,480
with RADARSAT and with satellites that

367
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,959
have been developed afterwards they've

368
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
learned so much from that whole so that

369
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,880
was um

370
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,199
an absolutely seminal and

371
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,440
thrilling moment to be

372
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,160
in the midst of all of that yeah they

373
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
were really concerned that the satellite

374
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
might not work and they could have been

375
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
obviously frieza

376
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
a big failure

377
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
which may have prevented us to do then

378
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,079
the following generation Envisat and

379
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,240
probably which would have prevent us

380
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,839
even to go the step forward with the

381
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,079
Sentinel and Copernicus program

382
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,639
so that reality that

383
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,000
ERS-1

384
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,760
first image

385
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,399
and the i would say the long city they

386
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,959
had for 48 hours then was removed and

387
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,639
then we have seen

388
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
30 years of progress in association at

389
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
ESA

390
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
with industry with our member state

391
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,519
but the the start of all beyond

392
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,360
Meteosat for meteo the start of all

393
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,639
was ERS-1 in particular that those

394
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,639
first SAR images

395
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,199
and after that of course everything

396
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,000
was was just fantastic we had

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,839
the pleasure and the privilege of

398
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,000
working with the world scientists on the

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
first

400
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,320
c-band SAR imagery and developing all of

401
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
the applications from scratch

402
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,199
and that's where i had some fun a few

403
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
months later in the field of SAR

404
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,199
interferometry you know my memory of

405
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,720
that is just

406
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,399
how lucky we were

407
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,240
to be able to

408
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,639
use those tools work with those people

409
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,600
and benefit from the expertise i

410
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
remember more or less i didn't sleep for

411
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
48 hours in the story but still this is

412
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,160
probably my best professional experience

413
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
and it was very early my career so an

414
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
incredible souvenir for me there was

415
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,920
information in

416
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,079
on agriculture on forestry

417
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,079
on oceans on ocean waves on ice you

418
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,839
could just select all of these images

419
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,680
and put them and people you could see

420
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,480
the science community just

421
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
raring to go

422
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,040
and and work on it and the rest is

423
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
history is as they say

424
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
now it's all routine and commonplace but

425
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,040
in those days it was trailblazing and a

426
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,639
privilege to be working with those

427
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,759
people

428
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,839
today we there's been a long discussion

429
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,880
about the archive data preserving the

430
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,160
archives

431
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,279
well

432
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
some of the observations the planet has

433
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
changed in 30 years

434
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,439
sea level has gone up temperatures have

435
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,480
gone up

436
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
there has been deforestation there has

437
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,199
been urbanization there has been coastal

438
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,240
change there have been glaciers

439
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,760
retreating

440
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,480
that data has contributed to our

441
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,559
understanding of all of that but it's

442
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
vital it contains the record of how the

443
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,559
planet was

444
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,320
so uh i mean everyone who contributed to

445
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,080
that was laying down

446
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
a historical record whose value today is

447
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,500
you know enormous

448
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,880
[Music]

449
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
the one thing i learned from all of that

450
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,200
is

451
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
that people who are in the space

452
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,000
business

453
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
problems are normal you know you're not

454
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
to be surprised that things don't work

455
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
and you sort of

456
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,480
get organized to understand and solve

457
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,200
the problems and i think that was the my

458
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
first real exposure

459
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,000
to how that worked and as i was saying i

460
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,160
i think we were dead lucky to have the

461
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,400
opportunity to just to be in a place to

462
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
do something about it but you know the

463
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
thing is i you know we're sitting here

464
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,400
discussing it and i i i think

465
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,720
we were just a tiny part

466
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,000
of you know an amazing team

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,640
of people you know and we we were just

468
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,160
happened to be there

469
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,919
uh and we had i mean it was the

470
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,880
foresight of uh actually

471
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,919
uh LiveEO and the ESTEC team to develop

472
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,320
this processor because if i think if we

473
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,880
had not produced the image there it

474
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,120
would probably come about

475
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,000
within the next 20 hours or so because

476
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,760
the guys up in in

477
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,919
in Kiruna were doing it and and i also

478
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,960
realized Paul was actually you know in

479
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
he was getting the information on both

480
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,200
sides so he was uniquely pleased to be

481
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,799
able to win and solve it but i just

482
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,720
think of the people you know one thing

483
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,120
is that moment but actually

484
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,679
you think of the amazing

485
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,200
experts

486
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
and and people we were able to work with

487
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
and without us having had the

488
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
opportunity to work with them

489
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
you know we wouldn't have had that

490
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
experience and it's really that team of

491
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,520
people you know who made all of that

492
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,360
happen and i think for us looking back

493
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,799
now uh more than just the moment you

494
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,200
know of that the joy of that is just

495
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
thinking what it took

496
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,360
to bring it to all of that all of the

497
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
skills and i think there's 80 companies

498
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,440
around Europe who built different

499
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,080
components all of those experts

500
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
instrument experts up in ESTEC that we

501
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,600
were working with you know you could

502
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,240
benefit from all of their expertise

503
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,400
and i think that's the essence of ESA

504
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,120
i remember in march we did the

505
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,960
first experiment to

506
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,480
say you could do differential

507
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,000
interferometers so you can measure

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
millimetric motion from space with with

509
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,039
those crazy corner reflectors nailed

510
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,000
across Germany thing about all that is

511
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,919
we were in the middle i mean it wasn't

512
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,240
us who did it we were in the middle of

513
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,440
an organization that had teams of

514
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
industry

515
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,280
teams of scientists the best scientists

516
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,600
in all the eastern member states and

517
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,400
beyond who we're all working together

518
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,919
and you could ask them would you do this

519
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,679
would you do that

520
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
and it just clicked into place and

521
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,200
produced these miraculous results first

522
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,799
results and that was just i think that

523
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,480
was like the learning experience from

524
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,480
ERS is this is how you operate a

525
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,880
mission you get up to achieve what the

526
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,640
mission is can achieve and then and

527
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,960
that's what's been done with Envisat 

528
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
with the explorers you always

529
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,679
understand and from that you know learn

530
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,679
how to do more i think that's what the

531
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,919
success really is it's about you know

532
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,600
going beyond what you're initially

533
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,919
developing developing the science which

534
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,919
allowed to develop the application which

535
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,080
developed the user interest

536
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,039
and

537
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,360
and then we do even better satellite

538
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,559
more

539
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,520
more accurate more diversified and

540
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,840
area now we are 30 years of archive

541
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,320
where we see the indisputable fact that

542
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
the change are fast especially in the in

543
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
the polar areas

544
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,320
and that's also a sense of achievement

545
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
because you see what we have

546
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,799
contribute to uh to develop the usage of

547
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,120
first observation has been fundamental

548
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,960
really to open the eyes that it was

549
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,280
truly a climate change on gooey not only

550
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,720
with the temperature immediate ground

551
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,159
with whatever

552
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,400
occurence in particular polar areas it

553
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,480
was all satellites

554
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,799
we will know much less indeed now but uh

555
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,880
the satellite role is is fundamental in

556
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,159
the awareness

557
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,360
of uh uh climatic change uh and not a

558
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,880
climatic change you know like we had in

559
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
the past but the very fast the speed at

560
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,760
which it happens yeah you know

561
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,640
we've been part of you know delivering

562
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,000
all this information about what's

563
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,159
actually happening on the planet it's

564
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,240
been immense progress to know what's

565
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,360
going on

566
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,559
um

567
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,799
would be great if there was a similar

568
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,720
progress on people actually

569
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
taking action based on the information i

570
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
mean

571
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,440
huge uh insights and scientific

572
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,280
knowledge about what's changing on the

573
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
planet policies remember when we were

574
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,320
doing all that work in the in the 90s

575
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
governments were writing you know the

576
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,559
the framework conventional climate was

577
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,520
set up

578
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
though there wasn't an established

579
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,919
scientific opinion that said

580
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,440
conclusively that climate change was

581
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,640
linked to

582
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
human impact that came

583
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,799
uh in the late 90s early 2000s

584
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,880
uh so we were working with science

585
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,720
community who had for more than two

586
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,640
decades had been busy putting the

587
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
observation systems together when that

588
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,679
came through but uh i i think we still

589
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,320
have a long long way to go before you'll

590
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,159
see people uh

591
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,799
who you know really seriously take the

592
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,140
decisions based on the evidence

593
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:04,940

594
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,760
i mean how you

595
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
sometimes ask is that an invented memory

596
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,039
or did it really happen
